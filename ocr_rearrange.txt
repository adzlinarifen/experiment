POTENTIAL FOR BIOMASS AND CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE 

  

  

  

  

The Technical Potential is found to be the greatest in Asia and Latin America, and lowest in Oceania, Non-OECD Europe, the Former Soviet Union and, OECD Europe. There appears to be vast storage potential in North America, Non-OECD Europe, the Former Soviet Union, Africa and the Middle East; however these regions are limited by the supply of sustainable biomass. Storage capacity does not seem to be a limiting factor, except where depleted hydrocarbon fields are used solely, though there is a need for consistent and detailed storage capacity estimates.

plants equipped with CCS. Electricity generation using biomass alone will make use of conversion technologies (i.e. combustion and gasification) that also allow capturing the CO;. However, there are also differences between biomass and fossil fuels when they are used for the production of electricity and heat. Biomass fuels typically have other combustion/gasification properties, lower energy density and greater variation in fuel properties. This may require modifications (e.g. pre-treatment and feeding, boiler design and burner configuration) in the energy conversion process to allow large scale use of biomass. Biomass plants are also typically smaller than plants fed with fossil fuels. This will have an effect on the economies of scale, particularly when applying CCS.

We then calculate the global potential, determined by the global storage and biomass potential assuming that inter-regional transport of biomass and CO. is allowed. Secondly, we exclude inter-regional transport of biomass. In the latter case, the BE- CCS potential may be lower as regional biomass availability may pose a constraint to the implementation of BE-CCS technologies.

independently of the type of fuel input (oil, coal, biomass and waste) (ZEP 2006). The type of fuel(s) used has an impact on the composition of the syngas exiting the gasifier. This will in turn affect for instance the shift process and CO, capture energy requirement. As far as we can ascertain, it is currently not known whether biomass (co-)gasification has a positive or negative influence on the efficiency penalty. The relative energy penalty for capture increases when applied to power plants with lower generating efficiencies. The lower conversion efficiency of dedicated BIGCCs does thus together with the capture penalty result in a lower conversion efficiency compared to co-gasification.

RD&D efforts regarding the storage of CO, are focused on a more detailed assessment of storage capacities going from theoretical capacity, via technical capacity to realisable or matched capacity (Bradshaw, Bachu et al. 2006). In practice, matching the temporal and geographical availability of sources and sinks may become a bottleneck. Matched capacity is therefore typically much lower than the theoretical capacity.

The negative GHG emissions associated with these estimates are highest for the FT biodiesel route (1 Gt of negative emissions) as the amount of CO; that is captured and stored per EJ of final energy is higher. This results in more negative emissions compared to the bio-ethanol route. The latter shows a maximum of 0.2 Gt of negative emissions in the year 2050.

Doubling the costs of CO, transport and storage leads to an increase of the production cost of maximally 16%. When the costs are halved, the production costs will decrease up to 7% . The impact on the economic potential is the largest for the co- firing routes. 

ECOFYS 

The CO, price also has, by influencing the production cost, a large impact on the economic potential of the routes. A decrease in production cost leads to an increase in economic potential as the economic advantage over the reference technologies in general improves. In absolute terms, the largest impact is expected for the IGCC and PC co-firing routes in 2030. For the IGCC route a low CO, price results in a significantly lower economic potential and a high price in significantly higher potential. For the PC route, an increase in CO, price leads to a significantly higher economic potential, i.e. about 50 EJ/yr higher. Lower CO, prices do, however, not result in a much lower potentials, except for the IGCC and BIGCC technologies. In 2050, almost all routes react strongly to a higher CO, price of 100 euro/t and economic potentials increase significantly.

are however influenced by CO; transport and storage cost. This is shown in Figure 8 - 9 and Figure 8 - 10.

Overall, these figures show that the results of our study are very sensitive to the estimated biomass supply curve and total primary biomass supply.

In a recent study by Luckow et al. (2010), production and utilisation of global biomass in, amongst others, the transportation and electricity sector amounted to 120-160 EJ/yr (primary) in the year 2050. In that study, both a 400 ppm and a 450 ppm target scenario was assessed. The upper value for global biomass production was found in the 400 ppm scenario. In the strict 400 ppm scenario, the dominant share of biomass is used for the production of electricity with CCS (75 EJ/yr) and without CCS (30 EJ/yr). In the 400 ppm scenario, approximately 14% of electricity supply is met by BE-CCS technologies. In that same scenario, 9% (15 EJ/yr) of the biomass potential is used for the production of refined liquids with BE-CCS technologies. In the 450 ppm scenario, the results indicate that the global biomass usage is lower in 2050 and that the share of biomass-fired conversion technologies equipped with CCS is significantly lower.

estimate the amount of CO, that can be stored. It is beyond the scope of this study to perform a detailed consistency analysis on the used storage estimates. Due to the unavailability of detailed storage capacity estimates, the technical potential may be minimally higher or lower than the \u2018best\u2019 estimate used in our study by a factor of 2. 

ECOFYS 

The analysis showed that the production cost of the BE-CCS technologies strongly depends on the CO, price, biomass price, discount rate and the primary biomass potential. Coal price and cost of CO, transport and storage has a lesser influence on the results. Regarding the cost assumptions for CO, transport and storage, it should be noted that we did not take source-sink matching into consideration. In practice, matching the temporal and geographical availability of sources and sinks may become a bottleneck. Additional cost for transport and/or storage will be incurred when detailed source-sink matching is applied. In a recent IEAGHG report (IEA GHG 2009), it was reported that the cost of transport and storage in depleted gas fields may vary significantly between regions. A regional specific cost curve for CO, transport and storage is not applied in our study, for reasons previously discussed in section 6.3.4. Instead, we used a range of values for the cost of CO, transport and storage covering the range of cost estimates reported in literature and assessed the impacts of lower or higher costs on the final result. This was deemed to be appropriate, considering the scope and level of detail of this study. It is however, recommended that if the BE-CCS potential is to be estimated on a more detailed level and on a regional basis, that regional specific supply curves are used. 

ECOFYS 

only a relative small storage capacity is required. Also, in the routes for power generation that are solely fed with biomass (no co-firing) less storage capacity is required when harvesting the full sustainable biomass potential. e The amount of CO, stored by conversion routes ranges between 1 and 21 Gt/yr, and depends mainly on the coal share in the primary energy input, the primary energy potential and the CO, capture efficiency. Negative emissions up to 10 Gt are the greatest for the dedicated routes with CCS: BIGCC and CFB. The negative emissions for the biofuel routes with CCS are the lowest, ranging between 0.5 and 6 Gt, because a smaller fraction of the CO, is captured and stored. Co-firing coal has a negative effect on the net GHG balance. 

ECOFYS 

Public perception is identified as a key factor in the success of BE-CCS. A negative perception of CCS and/or biomass will stall BE-CCS or may result in higher transport and storage costs. However, the combination of biomass conversion and CCS technologies may expect greater public support than the individual technologies.

Typical large scale combustion technologies available for biomass co-firing are pulverized coal power plant and fluidised bed combustion. The circulating fluidised bed (CFB) is available on the scale of several hundreds of MWe and can typically achieve high conversion efficiencies with high co-firing shares. Pulverized coal units are available in the GWe size range. The IEA GHG (IEA GHG 2009) report a net efficiency of 45.1 % (LHV) for a supercritical 500MWe CFB co-fired plant (10% biomass/90% coal). This is somewhat higher than the pulverized coal power plant assessed in that study with the same fuel mix that shows an efficiency of 44.8 %. 

the range between 16% and 30% for plants of about 50 MWe; however, efficiencies in the range of 30 to 36% are possible. Efficiencies for smaller plants are typically lower (Faaij 2006; IEA GHG 2009; IEA ETSAP 2010). Using municipal solid waste (MSW) as feedstock generally limits?\u00ae steam temperature and with it efficiency to about 22%. Newer installations can reach higher efficiencies of approximately 30%, however. 

results in a reduction of the overall efficiency of for instance a power plant. Depending on the type of solvent that is used, impurities need to be removed from the flue gas in order to limit operational problems. Examples are solvent degradation, foaming and fouling. Impurities that need to be removed are typically acid gases (NO,, SO,, HClI and HF) and particulate matter (PM). Power plants equipped with CO, capture should thus be equipped with highly efficient flue gas desulphurization (FGD), DeNO, installations and electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and/or fabric filters to remove PM. Also, the flue gas typically requires cooling before it is processed in the CO; capture installation (Koornneef 2010). 

higher efficiency loss estimate is found for the CFB option as equipping this power plant with capture requires additional flue gas cleaning. In the future, lower heat requirements for capture and increased generating efficiencies due to higher steam parameters may reduce capture energy requirements and improve overall generating efficiency significantly. 

section are challenges for the short-term (Koornneef 2010). The capture of CO, from biomass fired oxyfuel power plants have not been studied in detail and is therefore not included here. 

power plants the capital cost increases by 126% for CFB plants and by 114% for BFB plants compared to coal-fired plant of the same size. This increase includes required additional flue gas cleaning equipment. 

Main obstacles for combustion of biomass in general are: e Feedstock availability at low cost e Somewhat reduced generating efficiency compared to fossil fuels e Competition on arable land with food and fibre production o Risks associated with the large scale production of biomass, which may result in intensive farming, use of fertilizers and chemicals use and may have an impact on conservation of biodiversity e Technical obstacles such as slagging, fouling and corrosion in advanced power plants should be eliminated before widespread deployment can be effectuated.

technology and is commercially available in other applications than for electricity production. To make CO, capture with high efficiencies in the range of 85-95% possible, the syngas that is formed after gasification has to be shifted after it is cleaned. The \u2018water gas shift\u2019 (WGS) reaction, yields heat and a gas stream with high CO, and H; concentrations. The CO, can then be removed with chemical and physical solvents, adsorbents and membranes. For the near-term it is expected that chemical or physical solvents (or a combination) are used for the CO, removal. Syngas dilution with atmospheric nitrogen largely eliminates the benefits in air-blown gasification systems (Rhodes and Keith 2005; IEA/OECD 2006; Koornneef 2010).

To reduce energy consumption for the compression of captured CO,, the operating pressure of the fermentation installation can be increased. However, higher operating pressure has negative influence on the fermentation process (Ecofys 2007). 

ECOFYS 

The biomass gasification process typically utilizes air or nearly pure oxygen to generate syngas. Compared to air-blown gasifiers, oxygen blown gasifiers show superior performance in terms of efficiency. The thermal efficiency and calorific value of the syngas from biomass is lower than that from coal because of the typical high moisture content of the biomass (Demirbas 2005). Commercial coal gasification systems are available up to several GWth and currently about 15 GW,, of coal-to- liquid capacity is installed worldwide (IEA ETSAP 2010). For biomass, energy output is generally limited to about 80 MWth. Beside limitations in the economic supply of large quantities of biomass, large scale gasification of biomass is predominantly hindered by technical limitations (IEA ETSAP 2010). Examples are feeding systems design, corrosion issues and product gas cleaning. A wide range of feedstock can be gasified, including wood, charcoal, coconut shells and rice husks. However, depending on the specific design of a gasification system not all feedstock may be acceptable. An individual gasification system is typically designed to operate for a more narrow range of feedstock (Demirbas 2005; Bauen, Berndes et al. 2009; van Vliet, Faaij et al. 2009).
