The conversion efficiency (35%-45%) in large-scale coal plants is generally higher in comparison with dedicated firing. The size of the fossil power plant (up to a GWe) results in economies of scale and high conversion efficiency for biomass compared to dedicated bioenergy plants (Faaij 2006; IEA/OECD 2007). However, co-firing biomass negatively affects the conversion efficiency of coal fired power plant due to the lower heating value of biomass, high moisture content and energy requirement of feedstock pre-treatment. With low co-firing percentages this efficiency drop is considered to be modest (NETBIOCOF 2006; COFITECK 2008).

Shares of 40 to 50 % (on an energy basis), which is the subject of current development efforts, requires technical modifications in boiler design (burner configuration), biomass feeding lines (pre-treatment) and may result into more fouling, slagging and corrosion problems. This depends strongly on the ash melting behaviour and alkali and halogen compounds in the biomass. The composition of ashes is another possible concern as biomass firing changes ash composition, which may hinder the economic use of this by-product. This depends however strongly on the type of feedstock used. In short, biomass properties\u00ae\u201d limit the co-firing share.

This assessment is done separately for electricity production routes and routes for biofuel production. The scenario approach for the realisable potential is different compared to the approach used to determine the technical (and economic) potential. The technical potential is estimated in a static way looking at the view years 2030 and 2050 and does not depend on capital stock turnover, energy demand and deployment rate.

In a recent study ordered by EREC and Greenpeace (EREC and Greenpeace 2010), biomass potentials were also reviewed and assessed. Based on that review, they developed several scenarios varying food consumption, crop yields, agricultural activities and land use. Depending on the scenario this resulted in a global biomass potential estimate between 66 and 110 EJ/yr in 2020 and 94-184 EJ/yr in 2050. The overall technical potential\u00ae' is estimated to be 102 EJ/yr in 2020, 129 EJ/yr in 2030 and 184 EJ/yr in 2050. In Figure 9 - 1, an overview of estimates for sustainable biomass potentials in 2050 is presented. The figure shows estimates of sustainable biomass potentials up to almost 500 EJ/yr.

We use assumptions on the increase in energy demand and existing capacity that is replaced over time to estimate new capacity additions.

For the electricity routes, BE-CCS is applied in electricity production with \u2018Coal\u2019 and with \u2018Biomass and Waste'. The biofuel routes with CCS are assumed to only replace biofuel production without CCS. This is rather conservative as under stricter climate regimes, the potential for BE-CCS technologies may be higher (see (Luckow, Dooley et al. 2010)).

In addition, there is relative little experience with co-gasification of biomass and fossil fuels compared to co-firing in combustion concepts (Fernando 2009). The co- gasification of coal and biomass has been demonstrated in several types of gasifiers in several countries. It is expected that co-gasification rates in the order of 20-30 % (on energy basis) are technically feasible. Higher rates may be possible depending on the feedstock quality (e.g. high heating value, low moisture content). The scale of IGCC power plants is currently up to approximately 300 MWe. Current reference design plants are available at the scale of 600 MWe up to over one GWe. Scale up is expected to be possible by installing multiple gasifier trains feeding multiple gas turbine combined cycles (GTCC). Current conversion efficiencies of IGCCs are found up to 45% (LHV).

Coal price and cost of CO, transport and storage has a lesser influence on the results. Regarding the cost assumptions for CO, transport and storage, it should be noted that we did not take source-sink matching into consideration. In practice, matching the temporal and geographical availability of sources and sinks may become a bottleneck. Additional cost for transport and/or storage will be incurred when detailed source-sink matching is applied. In a recent IEAGHG report (IEA GHG 2009), it was reported that the cost of transport and storage in depleted gas fields may vary significantly between regions. A regional specific cost curve for CO, transport and storage is not applied in our study, for reasons previously discussed in section 6.3.4. Instead, we used a range of values for the cost of CO, transport and storage covering the range of cost estimates reported in literature and assessed the impacts of lower or higher costs on the final result. This was deemed to be appropriate, considering the scope and level of detail of this study.

We have assumed, in this study, that transport and storage costs for all BE-CCS routes are equal. We do however acknowledge that the capture cost for these routes is low compared to others. In that respect, they can be seen as early opportunities for BE-CCS. For these routes, with smaller but more pure CO, sources, it is recommended that further research is performed into which infrastructural conditions (i.e. network tie-in, sink priority for small sources) would result in an economically attractive business case.

The CO, must be removed to increase the partial pressure of CO and H; to assure a high synthesis efficiency of the FT process. The capture technology applied is in fact a pre-combustion capture technology. About 90% of the CO, in the syngas can typically be removed with this technology.

This CO, can be removed as well using a post-combustion technology (Dooley and Dahowski 2009; Larson, Fiorese et al. 2010). This requires however more energy compared to pre- combustion capture of CO, from the syngas and is considered to be more costly per tonne of CO,.

If there were no constraints on using all available resources, this potential would be the maximum potential or in this study, the theoretical potential. Technical potential is the potential applying current or future technical constraints, which for BE-CCS is constrained only by resource availability, CO, storage capacity, and future technical performance of the technology. Realisable potential is technically feasible, determined by possible deployment rate and expected demand, hence increases in time with deployment rate (where deployment rate is dependent on the possibility of applying BE-CCS to existing energy conversion technologies and retirement rate of technologies it replaces). The Realisable Potential is hence a limitation applied to the Technical Potential by including capital stock turnover, final energy demand and deployment rate. Economic potential is the potential at economic cost, considering cost of use of resources and of competing resources, determined by combining the price of biomass resources with the cost for biomass conversion and CCS; assessing the cost of producing electricity and biofuels with and without CCS, taking the CO, price into account. Therefore, the Economic BE-CCS Potential is the total final energy that can be converted at lower cost than the (fossil) reference technologies. Market potential, a variant of the economic potential, indicates the proportion of technical potential attractive to investors, including obstacles and drivers (e.g. regulation, subsidies and taxes).

Bio-ethanol from sugar and starch is the most common biofuel, accounting for more than 80% of total biofuel usage (IEA/OECD 2007; REN21 2010). Using well known and mature technologies the biofuel is produced based on the conversion of biomass into sugars, fermentation of 6-carbon sugars to ethanol and finally distillation to fuel grade ethanol (IEA/OECD 2007).

The difference in various terms used to define potentials lies in the limitations or constraints that have been applied to the \u2018availability of resources\u2019. The different potentials are illustrated in Figure 2 - 1. If there were no constraints on using all available resources then this is the maximum potential. This is the theoretical potential. If we apply current or future technical constraints, then we derive the technical potential. This potential indicates the amount of resources that can be maximally used or converted, depending on the technical status of conversion technologies. This is a constraint that varies over time due to technological progress. For Biomass and CCS technologies, the technical potential\u00ae is constrained only by the availability of sustainable biomass and CO, storage capacity, and the (future) technological performance of the technology. The realisable potential is the technology potential, but with an additional constraint determined by the possible deployment rate and expected (energy) demand. This means that the realisable potential increases in time, in accordance with the possible deployment rate. The deployment rate is constrained by the possibility of applying BE- CCS to existing energy conversion technologies and the retirement rate of existing technologies. The economic potential is the subset of the technical potential that can be realised at acceptable costs. This potential takes into consideration the cost of the use of resources and the cost of competing technologies. The market potential is also referred to as a variant of the economic potential. It indicates the proportion of the technical potential that is attractive to realise from the perspective of private investors. The market potential also includes obstacles and drivers (for example subsidies, taxes or regulation). A visual representation of market drivers and obstacles is provided in Figure 7 - 1. One can speak of the enhanced market potential if possible drivers are included, such as higher carbon prices and obligations.

This production process is therefore an interesting option to combine with CCS. Figure 4 - 6 shows the development status of routes to produce transport fuels from biomass. The first generation ethanol production from sugar and starch crops is currently a mature and commercial technology. The ethanol production is based on the enzymatic conversion of biomass into sugars, and/or fermentation of 6-carbon sugars with final distillation of ethanol to fuel grade. Technical and economical improvements can still be made by using improved enzymes and bacteria, process & plant optimization, improved water separation methods and by producing value-added by-products. Typical conversion efficiencies for conventional bio-ethanol production depend on the feedstock. In an Ecofys report (Ecofys 2007) conversion efficiencies for bio-ethanol production are reported to vary significantly per feedstock and are expected to be between 11 and 59% (HHV) in the coming decades. A typical plant size is at a scale of 200 MWy, which equates to an annual production of approximately 250 million litres. In this study, first generation bio-ethanol production is assumed to phase out over time as this route relies on feedstock that are generally also used for food (Bauen, Berndes et al. 2009).

Experts believe that commercial scale plants for advanced production will become available in the coming years (Bauen, Berndes et al. 2009). The specific investment cost of advanced bio-ethanol plants based on ligno-cellulosic biomass are estimated to be significantly higher than that of conventional bio-ethanol plants using sugar and starch based feedstock. It is estimated to be 3-5 times higher (see Appendix G for more details). Capital cost reductions due to economies of scale and lower feedstock cost makes the ligno-cellulosic option competitive in the longer run, according to several estimates in literature. This however strongly depends on the price of (fossil) alternatives. The potential development in terms of cost is shown in Table 6 - 6, where we can see that a cost decrease of 500 \u20ac/kW is expected over time. Long term cost estimates for conventional bio-ethanol are not shown here as this technology is assumed to phase out towards 2050. In earlier studies current bio-ethanol conversion cost in 2008 are estimated to range between 4.7 and 8.6 \u20ac/GJ (Bauen, Berndes et al. 2009). The conversion cost of advanced production of bio-ethanol is estimated between 4 and 6.7 \u20ac/GJ. The lowest figure represents cost in 2050.

The technical potential of BE-CCS routes is thus most often limited by the biomass potential. Less storage capacity is required for the routes producing biofuels and for the routes of power generation that only use biomass. In the biofuel routes a relatively small fraction of CO, is captured, therefore a relatively small storage capacity is required. In the 100% biomass routes for power generation, less storage capacity is required, as this route does not have to store CO; originated from coal conversion; this is the only the case in the co-firing routes. Only in the instance where depleted hydrocarbon fields are used alone, storage capacity may become a limiting factor.

The biomass potential is given as an annual potential (see Figure 4 - 9). The storage potential however is a finite resource which is given as the total amount of CO, that can be stored (see Figure 4 - 10). To estimate the amount of CO, that we can store on an annual basis, we need to convert this total amount of storage capacity to an annual storage capacity. In other words, we needed an approach to convert total CO, storage capacity estimates to an annual storage capacity estimate. For the technical potential, we therefore assumed that 1/50 of the total storage capacity can be used annually, i.e. the saturation period of the total capacity is 50 years (at immediate full deployment). The annual storage potential derived using this approach is shown in Figure 4 - 11. This is based on the conservative assumption that a project developer does not start a CO, injection activity if storage capacity is not assured for at least the entire lifetime of the energy conversion facility generating the CO,. As this rough assumption is likely to have considerable impacts on the assessment of the technical potential we include an uncertainty range for this factor and assess its impact on the results. The uncertainty range for this is chosen to lie between 30 and 70 years.

In conjunction with CO, capture from bio-ethanol production, this could provide early opportunities for BE-CCS at relatively low cost. Mapping these opportunities and examining technological and cost aspects in greater detail, on a case-by-case basis could be a valuable next step. e Short and long-term price estimations are pivotal to assessing the economic potential of biomass and CCS. Insights and quantification of the key factors that influence the trade volume and price of biomass would be a valuable next step for a more robust assessment of the economic potential of BE-CCS technologies. e The final recommendation is to focus research on gaining insight into the economic and infrastructural boundary conditions for CO, capture from bio- ethanol production, such as maximum economical transport distance and/or the minimal required CO, capture capacity.

We recommend that additional research efforts should be employed to verify our results with a more detailed assessment of factors that limit the sustainable supply of biomass on a regional base and assess the possibilities (including policy actions) for increasing the sustainable supply. e It is advised to also include assessing sustainable biomass supply options not explored in this study, such as aquatic biomass from algae and seaweed. o Detailed and consistent storage capacity estimates for world regions are currently not available. Although this is not specifically an issue for BE-CCS technologies alone it is recommended that the large uncertainty associated with estimating global storage potentials is appropriately addressed in future BE-CCS studies and that future research efforts are aimed at decreasing this uncertainty. e Although not expected to be a technical bottleneck, it is recommended to assess and test the effect of (co-)firing biomass on the performance of CO, capture options (pre- post- and oxyfuel combustion) in pilot/demonstration CCS plants. e A BE-CCS option omitted, amongst others, in this study is the co-utilization of biomass and coal in existing and new Fischer Tropsch facilities that are operating or planned worldwide. Next to CO, capture from bio-ethanol production this could provide early opportunities for BE-CCS at relatively low cost.

This would enable distributed production of biodiesel and reduces transport cost of both biomass (dominant) and end-product, and would reduce difficulties in feedstock procurement (Bauen, Berndes et al. 2009).
